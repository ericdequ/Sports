# Pulling: Leading the Charge on Outside Runs

Pulling is an essential skill set for guards in football, particularly when setting up outside runs. This maneuver requires a blend of agility, precision, and timing to open lanes for running backs. This article delves into the technique of pulling as a left guard, focusing on key aspects such as footwork, timing, and targeting defensive players in space.

## The Mechanics of Pulling

### Footwork
Footwork is the foundation of an effective pull. The initial steps are crucial:

1. **Stance**: Begin in a balanced three-point stance, with your weight evenly distributed and feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **First Step**: Lead with your inside foot, a quick 6-inch step to open your hips.
3. **Pivot and Drive**: Pivot on your inside foot, swinging your outside foot around. This motion should be fluid, like opening a door, keeping a low center of gravity.

### Timing
Proper timing is what turns a good pull into a great one. Here’s how to perfect it:

1. **Snap Recognition**: React to the center snapping the ball, but avoid false starts. Develop a keen awareness of snap counts and cadence.
2. **Synchronization**: Your pull movement should sync with the quarterback's and running back's actions. Practice with your team to ensure cohesive execution.
3. **Burst Speed**: Once the initial steps are complete, burst into the open space quickly. Speed is crucial to getting in front of the play and engaging your target defender.

### Targeting Defensive Players
Identifying and hitting your target is the climax of a successful pull:

1. **Reading Defenders**: Identify the most immediate threat to the play. This is usually an outside linebacker, defensive end, or a cornerback coming down in run support.
2. **Angles and Leverage**: Approach the defender with the right angle. Aim for leverage, hitting him on the inside shoulder to seal off the running lane.
3. **Engage and Drive**: Upon impact, maintain a strong base and drive the defender away from the play. Keep your hands inside the framework of their body to avoid penalties.

## Practice Drills
Here are a couple of drills to hone the pulling technique:

| Cone Drill           | Enhance agility and directional changes                 | Set up cones in a zigzag pattern. Practice pulling through the cones, focusing on sharp cuts and quick pivots. |
| Target Hit Drill     | Improve targeting and impact accuracy                   | Use a blocking sled or a dummy as the target. Simulate the pull and engage the sled/dummy on your coach's signal. |

## Coach's Corner: Wisdom for Aspiring Left Guards

1. **Stay Low, Stay Powerful**: Low pads win. Keeping a low center of gravity ensures that you maintain power and balance through the pull.
2. **Eyes Up**: Always keep your head on a swivel. Scan the field for potential defensive threats and adjust your target if needed.
3. **Consistency is Key**: Repetition builds muscle memory. The more you practice your pull motion, the more automatic it becomes during game situations.
