# Pulling Techniques: Leading the Way on Outside Runs

Pulling as a center might just be one of the most underappreciated skills in football. When executed flawlessly, it can turn a decent run into a breakaway play. In this guide, we delve into the nitty-gritty of pulling techniques for centers, emphasizing the essentials like footwork, timing, and identifying defensive targets in open space.

## The Foundation: Footwork

The success of a pull block starts with precise, lightning-quick footwork. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Snap and Initial Step**
    - **Execution**: Upon snapping the ball, the center must pivot their back foot quickly in the direction of the pull.
    - **Key Point**: This pivot should be explosive but controlled, setting up the entire motion.

2. **Crossover Step**
    - **Execution**: The crossover step involves crossing the front leg over the back leg in one fluid motion.
    - **Key Point**: Proper balance and body lean are essential here to maintain speed and agility.

3. **Additional Steps (Gallop Steps)**
    - **Execution**: Continue with fast, short steps, maintaining a low center of gravity. This keeps the center balanced and ready to react.
    - **Key Point**: Eyes should be up, scanning the field for defenders.

## Timing: The Unseen Hero

Timing the pull is crucial; a split-second too early or late can disrupt the entire play.

- **Count on instinct and practice**: Centers must rely on a combination of muscle memory and instinct, cultivated through repetition.
- **Pause and proceed**: Occasionally, a slight hesitation is warranted to let the play develop.

### Timing Tips

- **Practice drills** with varied snap counts to mimic game situations.
- **Visual cues**: Often, reading the action of the guards and tackles can provide clues for when exactly to begin the pull.

## Targeting Defensive Players

A center’s ability to effectively target defensive players in space is a game-changer. The focus here is on anticipating defensive movements and blocking in space.

### Steps to Effective Targeting

1. **Field Awareness**
   - **Execution**: Upon initiating the pull, constantly assess the layout of defensive players.
   - **Key Point**: Identify your primary target – typically the first defender in your lane – but be ready to adapt if the situation changes.

2. **Engagement**
   - **Execution**: Engage the defender with a solid block, aiming for their inside shoulder to seal the lane.
   - **Key Point**: Use proper blocking technique, leveraging your lower body strength to drive the defender out of the play.

3. **Open-Field Adjustments**
   - **Execution**: If primary target changes direction, be nimble and adjust to block the closest threat.
   - **Key Point**: Flexibility and reactive speed are essential to adapt to dynamic game scenarios.
