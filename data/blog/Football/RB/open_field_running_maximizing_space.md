# Open Field Running: Maximizing Space

## Introduction

Mastering open field running can turn a good running back into a great one. It's not just about speed and agility; it's about the vision to read blocks and the ability to angle your runs to exploit every possible yard. Let's break down the strategies that can help players maximize their gains in open field running.

## 1. Reading Downfield Blocks

One of the key aspects of open field running is the ability to read downfield blocks effectively. This skill helps runners decide the best path to take. Here are some tips:

### Identifying Key Blocks

**Primary Blockers:** Focus on the linemen and the fullback initially. Their blocks often set the initial direction of your run.

**Secondary Blockers:** Wide receivers and tight ends usually handle secondary blocks. Keep an eye on them to determine if you should break inside or outside.

### Pre-Snap Reading

**Defensive Formation:** Learn to read the defensive formation pre-snap. This can give you an idea of where blocks might develop and which defenders are likely to be free.

**Safety Depth:** The depth of the safeties can indicate whether a run is likely to be stopped early or if you'll have more room to maneuver.

### Post-Snap Reactions

**Patience Vs. Burst:** Sometimes patience is key. Allow your blocks to set up before you make your move. Conversely, recognize when it's time to put on the jets and burst through a hole.

**Use of Peripheral Vision:** Great runners use their peripheral vision to keep an eye on blockers and potential tacklers simultaneously.

## 2. Utilizing Angles

Maximizing gains isn't just about straight-line speed; it's about using angles to maneuver through the defense effectively.

### Cutting Angles

**45-Degree Cuts:** Often, a 45-degree cut can maximize forward momentum while still evading tacklers.

**Quick Juke:** A quick juke to a 90-degree angle can leave defenders grasping at air, especially if combined with a head fake.

### Reading Pursuit Angles

**Defender's Speed:** Awareness of the pursuer's speed and angle is crucial. Adjust your angle of attack to make it harder for them to catch you.

**Sideline as a Friend:** Use the sideline wisely. It can act as an additional blocker by limiting the defensive player's pursuit angle.

### Change of Pace

**Burst and Slow:** Mix up your speed. A sudden burst can catch a defender off guard. Conversely, slowing down might make them over-pursue, allowing you to cut back effectively.

### Exploiting Overpursuit

**Counters and Cutbacks:** If you notice defenders overcommitting, don't be afraid to cut back against the grain. This can turn lost yardage into a big gain.

## 3. Case Studies and Player Tips

### Case Study: Barry Sanders

Barry Sanders was a master at open field running. He combined incredible vision with sharp cutting angles. Watch his game tapes to see how he read blocks quickly and made split-second decisions.

### Player Tips

**Practice with Cones:** Set up cone drills that mimic downfield blockers and run through them at half-speed, focusing on your vision and cut angles.

**Watch Film:** Study film not just of your plays, but of great runners. See how they read defenses and followed their blockers.

**Communication with Blockers:** Building rapport with your blockers is essential. Understand their strengths and talk to them about what you see on the field.

## Conclusion

Open field running is an art form that requires a blend of vision, patience, speed, and agility. By mastering the strategies of reading downfield blocks and utilizing angles effectively, players can maximize their yardage on every run. Coaches should emphasize these techniques during practice, helping runners develop the instincts needed to become truly great in open field situations.

Remember, the next time you break free into the open field, it's not just about how fast you can runâ€”it's about how smart you can run.
