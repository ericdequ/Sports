# Footwork Drills: Enhancing Agility and Quickness

As any seasoned football coach or veteran running back will tell you, footwork is the foundation for success on the field. Improving agility, balance, and quickness can make a significant difference in a running back’s ability to evade tacklers and break through defensive lines. In this article, we'll explore several key footwork drills that cater specifically to running backs, blending professional insights and coaching wisdom.
