# Catching Out of the Backfield: Becoming a Dual Threat

In today's dynamic football landscape, running backs are expected to do more than just run the ball. Catching out of the backfield is a skill that can turn a decent back into a versatile, dual-threat weapon. Whether you're a player looking to improve or a coach aiming to elevate your team, mastering the following techniques will set you on the path to success.

## Route Running: Precision is Key

Route running isn't just for wide receivers. A running back who can run precise routes creates mismatches in the defense. Here's how to sharpen this skill:

### Basic Routes for RBs

| Route Name       | Description                                                                                      | Key Focus Area                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Flat Route       | A short route where the RB runs parallel to the line of scrimmage.                                | Quickness and staying low           |
| Angle Route      | A route where the RB fakes an outside run and then cuts back across the middle.                   | Sudden change of direction          |
| Texas Route      | Starts with a route towards the sideline, then cuts diagonally towards the middle of the field.   | Timing and deception                |
| Swing Route      | The RB swings out towards the sideline, typically as a safety valve for the QB.                   | Speed and maintaining spacing       |
| Wheel Route      | The RB runs towards the sideline and then turns upfield along the sideline.                       | Speed and tracking the ball         |

### Peeking Under the Hood

1. **Start with Stance**: Your stance should be balanced and ready to explode off the line.
2. **Set Up the Defender**: Use head fakes and body language to manipulate the defender’s positioning.
3. **Accelerate Through Cuts**: This is where most young players hesitate. Trust your footwork and speed through your cuts to maintain separation.

## Hand Positioning: The Fundamentals

Catching the football isn’t solely about having sticky hands; technique plays a crucial role.

### Golden Rules

- **Triangle Technique**: Form a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers when the ball is above your waist.
- **Pinkies Together**: When the ball is below your waist, place your pinkies together to create a basket.
- **Soft Hands**: Absorb the ball into your hands, rather than letting it hit your palms, reducing the risk of a drop.

### The Drill Deck

1. **Tennis Ball Drills**: Have a partner throw tennis balls at various angles to you. This sharpens reflexes and improves hand-eye coordination.
2. **Over-the-Shoulder Catches**: Practice tracking and catching balls thrown over your shoulder while running routes.
3. **JUGS Machine**: Set it to different speeds and angles to simulate game situations.

## Maintaining Focus: The Mental Game

Catching requires unwavering focus, especially in high-pressure situations. Here’s how to keep your head in the game:

### Focus Tips

1. **Visualization**: Picture successful catches throughout your practice routine.
2. **Catch Tally**: Keep count of successful catches during practice to build confidence and track progress.
3. **Short Memory**: Forget the drops and focus on the next catch – sharp mental recovery is crucial.

### In-Game Focus Strategies

- **Pre-Snap Checklist**: Know your assignment and visualize your route before the snap.
- **Quarterback Connection**: Develop a strong rapport with your QB through consistent practice and communication.
- **Breathing Techniques**: Use controlled breathing to stay calm and focused during high-pressure plays.

## Conclusion

Becoming a dual-threat running back demands dedication, practice, and a keen understanding of both physical and mental aspects of the game. By refining your route running, honing your catching techniques, and maintaining sharp focus, you can elevate your game and become an indispensable asset to your team.

Happy training, and remember: **catching isn't just an art; it's a science**.
