# Run Blocking: Creating Lanes on the Right Side

Run blocking is the bread and butter of any effective running game. It's all about clearing paths and creating lanes for your running backs to exploit. When executed correctly, solid run blocking can dominate defenses and control the game clock. This article dives into the key strategies for run blocking on the right side of the line, focusing on drive blocks, combo blocks, and leveraging techniques.

## Strategies for Dominant Run Blocking

To become a superior run-blocking unit, players and coaches alike need to focus on three critical areas: drive blocks, combo blocks, and leveraging. Understanding and mastering these techniques can make or break a Teams running game.

### Drive Blocks

Drive blocks are the foundation of effective run blocking. They involve a lineman taking on a defender one-on-one and driving them off the line of scrimmage. Here's how to perfect the drive block:

1. **Stance and Alignment**: Begin in a three-point stance with a balanced base. Ensure your weight is evenly distributed to explode off the line.
2. **First Step**: Your first step should be explosive and quick. Aim for a 6-inch step directly at your defender.
3. **Hand Placement**: Hands should strike the defender's chest plate with thumbs up, creating a powerful punch.
4. **Drive and Finish**: Once engaged, maintain low pad level and drive your feet while keeping your hips under you. Continue driving until the whistle blows.

#### Tips for Effective Drive Blocks

- Stay low to maintain leverage.
- Keep your head up and eyes on the defender's chest.
- Use your legs to generate power, not just your upper body.

### Combo Blocks

Combo blocks require coordination between two linemen to initially double-team a defender before one peels off to the second level. This technique is vital against stout defensive fronts. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Communication**: Pre-snap communication is key. Identify the defender to double team and the linebacker to target at the second level.
2. **Initial Double Team**: Both linemen target the defender with low pad level and synchronized footwork.
3. **Peeling Off**: The lineman who senses less resistance from the defender peels off to engage the linebacker, while the other maintains the block.

#### Tips for Successful Combo Blocks

- Communicate effectively, both pre-snap and during the block.
- Feel for the defender's movement to decide who will peel off.
- Maintain pad level and footwork synchronization for as long as possible.

### Using Leverage

Leverage is the great equalizer in run blocking. Utilizing leverage means playing with lower pad level and better angles than the defender. Here's how to use leverage effectively:

1. **Low Pad Level**: Keep your hips and knees bent, and aim to be the lowest player on the field.
2. **Angle of Attack**: Approach the defender with proper angles, aligning your body to maximize the force exerted.
3. **Hand and Elbow Position**: Strike with your hands inside and elbows tight to your body, giving you control and maximizing power.

#### Tips for Maintaining Leverage

- Always bend at the knees, not the waist.
- Use your hands and feet in unison to maintain balance and power.
- Practice agility drills to improve movement and balance.

## Conclusion

Mastering run blocking on the right side is no easy feat, but with dedication to drive blocks, combo blocks, and leveraging techniques, any offensive line can push defenders back and open up running lanes. Remember, communication, technique, and continuous practice are your best allies. Dominate the trenches and watch your ground game flourish!
