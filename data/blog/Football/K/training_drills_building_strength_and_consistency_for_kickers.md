# Training Drills: Building Strength and Consistency for Kickers

Kicking in football is a craft that blends technique, power, and precision. Whether you are a coach or a player striving to improve in this area, it’s essential to focus on specific training drills that build leg strength, enhance accuracy, and ensure consistency. Let's walk through a few well-rounded drills and exercises that can elevate your kicking game.

## Building Leg Strength

To kick long and accurately, you need explosive leg power. Here are some killer exercises to add to your regimen:

### Dynamic Squats

Dynamic squats focus on building explosive power:

- **How-to**: Start in a squat position and explode upwards into a jump.
- **Sets/Reps**: 3 sets of 15 reps
- **Pro Tips**: Ensure your landings are soft to prevent knee injury and always maintain that core tight.

### Bulgarian Split Squats

This exercise specifically targets the quads, hamstrings, and glutes:

- **How-to**: Place one foot on a bench behind you and squat down with the other leg.
- **Sets/Reps**: 3 sets of 12 reps each leg
- **Pro Tips**: Utilize dumbbells for added resistance as you advance.

### Box Jumps

Box jumps enhance overall leg strength and explosive power:

- **How-to**: Jump onto a sturdy box and step down gently.
- **Sets/Reps**: 3 sets of 10 jumps
- **Pro Tips**: Use a box height that challenges you without compromising your form.

## Accuracy Drills

Accuracy can make or break a successful kick. Here are drills to refine precision:

### Cone Drill

Place cones at various distances and directions from the goal to simulate real game situations:

| Distance | Angle | Goal |
|----------|-------|------|
| 20 yards | 30°   | Hit inside left upright |
| 30 yards | 0°    | Center of crossbar   |
| 35 yards | 15°   | Hit inside right upright |

- **How-to**: Aim to hit the specific target denoted by each cone.
- **Pro Tips**: Visualize a straight line towards your target and follow through.

### Target Practice

Using targets can dramatically improve accuracy:

- **How-to**: Attach small targets to the goalposts.
- **Drill**: Aim to hit or pass within a tight radius of these targets.
- **Pro Tips**: Record and review your kicks to analyze your alignment and approach angles.

## Consistency Routines

A kicker’s best friend is consistency. Master these routines to maintain peak performance:

### Swing Repetition

Consistency comes with repetition:

- **How-to**: Set up a tee and work on your swing motion relentlessly without a ball.
- **Sets/Reps**: 50 swings daily
- **Pro Tips**: Focus on form—plant foot placement, body posture, and follow through.

### Routine Workouts

Establishing a routine builds muscle memory:

- **Dynamic Warm-Up**: 10 minutes of dynamic stretches
- **Kick Sequence**: Repeat your kicking sequence multiple times, refining the minor details.
- **Cool-Down**: Stretch and roll out to prevent injury and maintain flexibility.

### Video Analysis

Reviewing your performance can identify improvements:

- **How-to**: Record your kicks, break them down, and analyze footage.
