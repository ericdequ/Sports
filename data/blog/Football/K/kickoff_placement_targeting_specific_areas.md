# Kickoff Placement: Targeting Specific Areas

In the world of American football, the kickoff is more than just a mere start to play—it's a tactical opportunity to influence field position, limit the opponent's options, and set the tempo for the game. Skilled kickers and strategic coaches understand that where and how the ball is placed can determine the outcomes of entire games. Here, we dive deep into the art and science of kickoff placement, exploring methods to aim for touchbacks, corner kicks, and strategic placements.

## The Art of The Touchback

Aiming for a touchback can be a game-changer. It prevents any return and ensures the opposing team starts at their 25-yard line, automatically nullifying any potential big plays from the return team. Here are some key tips and tricks:

### Player Tips

- **Power and Consistency:** As a kicker, focus on building leg strength to drive the ball deep into the end zone consistently.
- **Wind Factor:** Always consider the wind direction and speed. A solid understanding of how wind affects flight distance can increase the likelihood of achieving touchbacks.
- **Ball Placement:** Properly aligning the ball on the kicking tee can aid in ensuring you're getting maximum height and distance.

### Coaching Wisdom

- **Form Drills:** Encourage kickers to perform drills that improve their form and technique, focusing on maintaining balance and maximizing leg drive.
- **Film Study:** Regularly review game footage to identify patterns in opponents' kickoff returns. Use this data to decide whether touchbacks or other strategies are more effective.

## Corner Kicks: Pinning Opponents

Corner kicks can be used to pin the opposing team deep within their own territory, typically within the 10-yard line. This strategy relies not just on distance but also on precision.

### Player Tips

- **Directional Kicking:** Develop skills to aim kicks towards the sideline without going out of bounds. Practice consistently hitting specific targets during training.
- **Hang Time:** Focus on achieving hang time that allows your coverage team to get downfield quickly.

### Coaching Wisdom

- **Coverage Coordination:** Work with your coverage team to ensure they understand the path of the ball and their containment lanes.
- **Situational Drills:** Set up simulations in practice to replicate high-pressure situations where corner kicks might be necessary.

## Strategic Placement: Precision Matters

In certain situations, strategic placement kicks—such as pooch kicks or squib kicks—can be highly effective in creating confusion and limiting returns. 

### Types of Strategic Kicks

| **Kick Type** | **Purpose** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Pooch Kick**| Short, high hang time kick | Forces fair catches; avoids deep returns | Risk of giving good field position|
| **Squib Kick**| Low, bouncing kick | Creates chaos; limits organized returns | Can give the offense favorable yardage |
| **Onside Kick**| Short and quick kick to regain possession | Potential to regain possession quickly | Very high risk and low success rate|

### Player Tips

- **Versatility:** Train to master different types of kicks, adjusting power and angle to suit game scenarios.
- **Reading the Field:** Be aware of the return formation and adjust your kick accordingly.

### Coaching Wisdom

- **Game Context:** Use these kicks judiciously based on game context, score, and time remaining.
- **Special Teams Readiness:** Ensure your special teams unit is always prepared for sudden shifts in strategies.
