# Handling Power Rushers: Techniques for Success

In the trenches of the gridiron, there's a constant battle between the offensive line and the defensive front. One of the most formidable adversaries for any offensive lineman is the power rusher. These defensive players rely on brute strength and leverage to collapse the pocket and disrupt plays. To counteract their formidable presence, offensive linemen must employ a blend of technique and strength. In this article, we’ll break down the essential strategies to neutralize power rushers, focusing on maintaining leverage, using strength, and proper hand placement.

## Maintaining Leverage

Leverage is the foundation of successful blocking. Without it, even the strongest linemen can be overwhelmed by a savvy power rusher. Here's how you can ensure you're always in a position of power:

1. **Stay Low**:
   - **Principle**: Low man wins.
   - **Technique**: At the snap, get into a low stance with knees bent and hips down to engage the rusher with a solid base.

2. **Proper Footwork**:
   - **Principle**: Balance and agility.
   - **Technique**: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and take short, choppy steps to maintain balance and adjust to the defender’s movements.

3. **Pad Level**:
   - **Principle**: Control and contact point.
   - **Technique**: Keep your pads lower than the rusher’s, driving up with your legs to leverage your body weight effectively.

## Using Strength

Strength is a critical component in battling power rushers, but it's not just about raw power. Functional strength that includes stability and explosiveness is key.

1. **Core Strength**:
   - **Principle**: Stability and power transfer.
   - **Technique**: Engage your core muscles to ensure that you can withstand the initial surge of the power rusher. Exercises like planks and deadlifts are beneficial.

2. **Upper Body Strength**:
   - **Principle**: Punch and control.
   - **Technique**: Develop strong arms and chest to deliver an effective punch and control the rusher. Bench presses and push-ups are traditional but highly effective exercises.

3. **Leg Drive**:
   - **Principle**: Movement and momentum.
   - **Technique**: Use your legs to drive the defender backward. Squats and lunges will build the necessary lower body power.

## Proper Hand Placement

Hand placement can be the difference between holding or a clean block. This aspect of blocking requires precision and tactical savvy.

1. **Initial Punch**:
   - **Principle**: Shock and awe.
   - **Technique**: At the snap, deliver a firm punch to the rusher’s chest plate to stun and momentarily halt their forward momentum.

2. **Hand Positioning**:
   - **Principle**: Control and redirect.
   - **Technique**: Keep your hands inside the defender’s shoulders to avoid holding penalties and gain maximum control. If they go outside, you're likely to get flagged.

3. **Re-engage and Adjust**:
   - **Principle**: Adaptability.
   - **Technique**: If the rusher counters your initial block, quickly re-engage by adjusting your hand placement to maintain control.
