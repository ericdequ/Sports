# Pulling: Leading the Way on Outside Runs

Executing an outside run play successfully relies heavily on the technique and precision of the offensive line, particularly the left tackle. Pulling as a left tackle requires a meticulous blend of footwork, timing, and the ability to locate and neutralize defensive players in space. Let’s break down these critical components:

## The Art of Pulling

Pulling involves the offensive lineman, usually a tackle or guard, moving laterally to lead block for the running back on outside runs. Here, we’ll focus on the left tackle’s role in this dance of agility and power.

### Footwork: Keeping It Clean

Proper footwork is the foundation of an effective pull. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Initial Step:** 
   - **Kick Slide:** Start with a quick, sharp kick slide away from the line of scrimmage to avoid any immediate engagement with nearby defenders.
   
2. **Crossover Steps:**
   - Maintain a low center of gravity and use short, powerful crossover steps to create lateral movement. The goal here is to keep your hips square to the line of scrimmage.
   
3. **Turn and Burn:**
   - As you approach the edge, pivot your inside foot towards your target. This pivot should be fluid to maintain momentum and balance.

### Timing: The Invisible Clock

The success of an outside run can hinge on the split-second timing of your pull:

1. **Snap Read:**
   - Anticipate the snap count like a hawk. The moment the ball is snapped, your first step must be explosive.
   
2. **Synchronize with Backfield:**
   - Ensure your movement aligns with the running back’s path. Consistently practice with your backfield to achieve seamless synchronization.
   
3. **Hesitation Be Gone:**
   - Do not hesitate in the pulling motion. Any delay can disrupt the flow of the play and give defenders the opportunity to clog running lanes.

### Targeting Defensive Players: Clearing the Path

Once you’ve mastered footwork and timing, the final piece of the puzzle is effective targeting:

1. **Pre-Snap Read:**
   - Identify the key defensive players who could potentially disrupt the play. This often includes outside linebackers or defensive ends.
   
2. **Point of Contact:**
   - Aim for a strong, solid contact at the defender’s numbers. Use your hands to steer them away from the intended running lane.
   
3. **Seal the Edge:**
   - Once engaged, your goal is to either drive the defender out of bounds or turn them inward, creating a clear path on the outside for the running back.

### Pulling Techniques Table

To aid in understanding, here’s a concise table summarizing the primary techniques in pulling as a left tackle:
