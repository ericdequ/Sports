# Run Blocking Drills: Improving Power and Precision

Run blocking is the unsung hero of a successful running game in football. A cohesive offensive line can be the difference between a breakout play and a loss of yardage. To achieve this, players need to master both power and precision in their blocking techniques. Whether you're a player looking to elevate your game or a coach aiming to build a formidable line, these drills are designed to fine-tune those essential skills.

## Importance of Power and Precision

Power is crucial for creating push against the defensive line, while precision ensures proper targeting and engagement with defenders. Balancing these aspects allows for consistent and effective run blocking. Hereâ€™s how you can bring them together through targeted drills:

### Drill 1: The Gauntlet Drill

**Purpose:** Improve initial contact power and follow-through in blocks.

**Setup:**
- 6-8 blocking pads
- Line up the pads in a staggered format to mimic a defensive line

**Execution:**
1. **Stance and Start:** Players begin in a three-point stance.
2. **Engage:** At the whistle, the player explodes from their stance and engages the first pad with equal force.
3. **Drive:** Continue through each pad, maintaining low pad level and driving with legs.

|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Start       | Explosion    | Low pad level, fast burst       |
| Engage Pad 1| Initial Hit  | Strong hands, chest-to-chest    |
| Engage Pad 2| Sustained Push| Maintain leverage, keep feet active|
| Through Pad | Follow-Through| Drive through, finish strong    |

### Drill 2: Ladder Footwork

**Purpose:** Enhance footwork precision and agility.

**Setup:**
- Agility ladder

**Execution:**
1. **Basic Steps:** Begin with two feet in each square, focusing on quick, controlled movements.
2. **Lateral Movement:** Transition to side shuffles, ensuring feet stay inside the ladder squares.
3. **Change of Direction:** Incorporate directional changes at the command of the coach, emphasizing quick foot placement and balance.

### Drill 3: Combo Blocking

**Purpose:** Develop precision in executing combo blocks with a teammate.

**Setup:**
- Partner pairings (one offensive lineman, one defensive player)
- Blocking sled

**Execution:**
1. **Communication:** Pre-snap communication between linemen on target defender.
2. **Initial Double Team:** Execute double team block on defensive lineman, focusing on shared leverage.
3. **Peel Off:** One lineman peels off to second-level defender, ensuring the initial block maintains its strength.
