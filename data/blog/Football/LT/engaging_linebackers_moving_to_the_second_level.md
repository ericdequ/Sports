# Engaging Linebackers: Moving to the Second Level

When it comes to executing successful run and pass plays, one critical aspect often overlooked is the art of moving to the second level and engaging linebackers. This critical maneuver can turn an ordinary play into an extraordinary one. In this article, well delve deep into the techniques, both from a player's perspective and through the lens of coaching wisdom.

## Understanding the Second Level

The “second level” refers to the linebackers in a defensive scheme. These players are typically positioned just behind the defensive linemen. Successfully engaging them can free up routes for runners and receivers, making it a game-changer. 

## Techniques for Run Plays

### 1. Initial Engagement

Before moving to the second level, make sure the first level is secure. This means your initial block on the defensive line should be solid. This may involve:
- **Chipping**: A quick and powerful block on the defensive lineman.
- **Combo Blocks**: Working in tandem with another lineman to initially engage a defender, then one player releases to the second level.

### 2. Reading the Defense

Understand the defensive alignment and likely movement of the linebackers. Pre-snap reads and play recognition are crucial:
- **Eyes Up**: Always keep your head on a swivel and eyes scanning for linebackers’ shifts.
- **Anticipate Movement**: Recognize if the linebacker is playing downhill (aggressively toward the line) or scraping (moving laterally).

### 3. Engage and Sustain

When engaging a linebacker, your technique should include:
- **Taking a Proper Angle**: Aim for the linebacker’s inside shoulder to cut off their pursuit angle.
- **Strong Hands**: Use your hands to steer and control the defender.
- **Leverage**: Maintain a low center of gravity for stronger engagement.

| Technique       | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Chipping**    | Quick block to momentarily engage D-lineman |
| **Combo Blocks**| Two linemen work together, then one releases |
| **Proper Angle**| Aim for inside shoulder of linebacker       |
| **Strong Hands**| Control and steer the defender              |
| **Leverage**    | Keep low center of gravity                  |

## Techniques for Pass Plays

### 1. Communication

Before the snap, ensure clear line communication to identify potential blitzing linebackers or complex stunts.

### 2. Quick Feet

On the snap, the offensive lineman should be light on their feet to swiftly transition from initial protection to second-level engagement:
- **Slide and Mirror**: Use side steps or shuffling to mirror the movements of the linebacker.

### 3. Hand Placement

Proper hand placement can mean the difference between a sustained block and a quick shed:
- **Inside Hands**: Keeping your hands inside the frame of the defender gives you more control.
- **Punch and Reset**: A quick, forceful hand strike followed by immediate repositioning.

### 4. Knowing When to Release

In pass protection, releasing to the second level needs timing. Overcommit and you expose the quarterback; hesitate and you miss your chance:
- **Timed Release**: Release immediately after ensuring the defensive lineman is contained or diverted.

| Technique       | Description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication**| Pre-snap identification of blitzing linebackers    |
| **Quick Feet**   | Swift transition from protection to engagement     |
| **Slide and Mirror**| Side steps to follow linebacker movements      |
| **Inside Hands** | Control defender by keeping hands inside their frame|
| **Punch and Reset**| Quick strikes to disrupt linebacker’s momentum  |
| **Timed Release**| Release after containing initial threat           |

## Coaching Tips

- **Drills and Repetitions**: Regularly drill both run and pass blocking transitions in practice.
- **Film Study**: Encourage players to watch film and recognize linebacker tendencies.
- **Feedback and Adjustment**: Provide immediate feedback during practice sessions and use constructive critique to hone techniques.
- **Emphasize Footwork**: Many blocks are won or lost with footwork, so prioritize agility drills and balance exercises.

## Conclusion

Mastering the move to the second level and effectively engaging linebackers is an invaluable skill for any offensive lineman. Combining solid fundamental techniques with strategic play recognition can elevate both run and pass plays. By integrating these methods into practice, players can transform ordinary plays into game-winning moments.
