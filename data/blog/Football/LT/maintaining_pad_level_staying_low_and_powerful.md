# Maintaining Pad Level: Staying Low and Powerful

One of the key fundamentals for any offensive lineman in football is maintaining the proper pad level. This vital technique can make the difference between a successful block and a defensive tackle or sack. Letâ€™s dive into the mechanics and drills that can help players stay low and powerful.

## Why Pad Level Matters

In both pass protection and run blocking, the leverage battle is often won by the player with the lower pads. When an offensive lineman maintains a low pad level, they achieve better balance, power generation, and control. Understanding pad level begins with understanding the physics:

- **Lower center of gravity:** Enhances stability and makes it harder for defenders to uproot the lineman.
- **Force Application:** Enables the lineman to generate greater force using their legs and hips.
- **Control:** Increases the ability to control the defender, giving the quarterback more time or creating lanes for the running back.

## Techniques for Maintaining Pad Level

### Stance and Start

- **Stance:** Start with a solid three-point or two-point stance, ensuring your weight is on the balls of your feet. Your knees should be bent, hips low, and chest up.
- **Initial Step:** Push off with a strong first step, keeping your pad level low by driving through your hips and knees.

### Hands and Hips

- **Hand Placement:** Engage the defender with palms to their chest, aiming to strike upward from a low starting position.
- **Hip Drive:** Utilize the power of your hips to drive the defender back. Think of it as lifting with your legs rather than your back.

### Eyes Up, Back Straight

- **Head Position:** Keep your eyes up and aimed forward, maintaining awareness of the opponent while ensuring your back remains straight.
- **Back Alignment:** A straight back from the hips to the shoulders ensures that the power generated through the legs is effectively transferred to the upper body.

## Drills to Enhance Low Pad Level 

### Sled Work

**Setup:** 
- Utilize a blocking sled to practice maintaining low pad levels.
  
**Execution:** 
- Drive the sled with consistent, powerful steps while keeping your hips low.
- Focus on striking the sled with upward hand movements.

### One-on-One Blocking

**Setup:** 
- Partner up with a teammate or use a coaching dummy.

**Execution:** 
- Engage in one-on-one drills to practice staying low and using the correct hand and hip techniques.
- Emphasize quick hands and powerful hip thrusts.

### Chute Drills

**Setup:** 
- Use a low-hanging chute to force players to stay low during the drill.
  
**Execution:** 
- Players must navigate through the chute, maintaining their bent-knee stance and low pad level.
- This correctional tool ensures that players cannot stand upright without hitting the chute.

## Coaching Wisdom

As a coach, it is paramount to consistently remind your players about the importance of pad level during practice. Utilizing video reviews can highlight both successes and areas for improvement. Encourage your linemen to constantly think about their pad level until it becomes second nature. 

Remember, the battle in the trenches is often won by the player who can stay low, drive power through their hips, and maintain the balance. So, reinforce these fundamentals and watch your offensive line dominate the line of scrimmage.
