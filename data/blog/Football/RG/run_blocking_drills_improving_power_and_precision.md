# Run Blocking Drills: Improving Power and Precision

When it comes to dominating the run game in football, the key lies in effective run blocking. This blend of raw power and precise technique can make or break an offensive line's ability to create gaps and drive the game forward. Let's dive into some essential drills that can enhance power and precision in run blocking.

## 1. Drive Blocking Drill

### **Objective:** 

Develop explosive power and sustained push in the run block.

### **Setup:**

- Pair players up with one acting as the blocker and the other as a defender.
- Use blocking sleds for added resistance.

### **Execution:**

1. **Stance:** The blocker starts in a three-point stance, focusing on a low pad level.
2. **Hit:** On the coachâ€™s whistle, explode into the sled or defender, driving with the legs.
3. **Follow-Through:** Maintain the blocking stance and drive the opponent backward for at least five yards.

### **Coaching Tips:**

- Ensure players keep a wide base and low center of gravity.
- Hands should strike the chest plate of the sled/defender while maintaining tight elbows.

## 2. Angle Blocking Drill

### **Objective:** 

Improve angle blocks to seal the defensive line and create running lanes.

### **Setup:**

- Set up cones to represent alignment of the defensive line.
- Blockers will align at an angle to the cones.

### **Execution:**

1. **Stance and Set Angle:** The blocker aligns in a three-point stance facing the cone at an angle.
2. **First Step:** On the snap, take a 45-degree step to the set angle.
3. **Engage:** Strike with the inside hand while pivoting the hips to maintain contact and steer the defender.

### **Coaching Tips:**

- Emphasize quick, decisive first steps.
- Blockers should use their body to shield the defender from the running lane.
- Focus on hip rotation to generate torque and control.

## 3. Double Team Drill

### **Objective:**

Enhance coordination and power in double-team blocking.

### **Setup:**

- Pair up blockers on a single defender.
- Use a dummy or a coach standing in for the defender.

### **Execution:**

1. **Stance:** Both blockers adopt a three-point stance.
2. **Engagement:** On the whistle, both blockers hit the defender with synchronized steps.
3. **Drive:** They drive the defender back together, focusing on maintaining leverage and coordination.

### **Coaching Tips:**

- Communication between blockers is crucial; use verbal cues.
- Maintain tight hand placement and ensure both blockers stay on the same level.
- Highlight the importance of keeping eyes up to adjust to defensive reactions.

## 4. Pulling Drill

### **Objective:** 

Improve timing and footwork for pulling guards and tackles.

### **Setup:**

- Set up cones to simulate defensive line positions.
- Blockers align in their regular positions.

### **Execution:**

1. **Stance and First Step:** The blocker pulls by stepping back with the play-side foot.
2. **Run the Arc:** Swing around the cones, simulating moving through the line.
3. **Kick Out/Seal Block:** Finish by engaging an assigned defender or another cone representing the linebacker.

### **Coaching Tips:**

- Emphasize quickness and fluid footwork.
- Ensure players keep their shoulders square and eyes up to locate the target.
