# Run Blocking: Powering Through Defenders

When it comes to a successful running game, the offensive line is the unsung hero. These players are the cornerstone of the offense, tasked with creating openings for the running back. This article dives into the various strategies to master run blocking, emphasizing drive blocks, combo blocks, and leveraging techniques to overpower defenders.

## The Essentials of Run Blocking

### 1. **Drive Blocks: The Foundation of Power**

Drive blocks are the fundamental run blocking technique, designed to physically move the defender off the line of scrimmage. Here's how to perfect them:

- **Stance and Start:** Begin with a solid three-point stance, ensuring balance and an explosive start.
- **First Step:** Your first step should be quick and small, aimed at gaining leverage and staying low.
- **Hand Placement:** Aim for the inside numbers of the defender's chest, establishing a firm grip.
- **Driving Through:** Use your legs to drive through the defender, maintaining leverage by staying low.

### 2. **Combo Blocks: Two Are Better than One**

Combo blocks involve two linemen working together to take on defensive linemen or linebackers. They are especially effective against aggressive fronts.

- **Communication:** Effective combo blocks start with clear communication. Identify who will handle which defender.
- **Coordination:** Start with a double-team on the primary defender, then one lineman transitions to the second-level defender.
- **Timing:** The key is timing the release to the second level so that the first defender is neutralized without a break in the block.

| Key Elements      | Drive Blocks                          | Combo Blocks                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Objective         | Move defender off the line            | Double-team one and transition         |
| Initial Contact   | Lineman vs. One Defender              | Two Linemen vs. One Defender           |
| Execution         | Leverage and Power                    | Communication and Timing               |
| Success Indicator | Defender driven back or aside         | Effective transition to second level   |

### 3. **Leverage Techniques: Winning the Battle of Angles**

Leverage is about utilizing body positioning to control and move defenders. It's a crucial aspect of both drive and combo blocks:

- **Staying Low:** The lower man wins. Keep your pad level low to gain leverage.
- **Hand Positioning:** Use inside hand positioning to control the defender's chest and core.
- **Angle of Attack:** Attack on the correct angle to ensure you can sustain and steer the block.

## Advanced Tips from Coaches

### **Practice Drills for Mastery**

- **Sled Drills:** Perfect for developing the power needed for drive blocks.
- **Bag Work:** Helps in refining hand placement and leverage techniques.
- **Partner Blocking Drills:** Focus on coordination and communication for combo blocks.

### **Mental Preparation**

- **Film Study:** Regularly reviewing game tape helps understand opposing defenses and improve reaction to different fronts.
- **Mindset:** Embody aggressiveness and focus. Visualize successful blocks to build confidence.

## Conclusion

Dominating defenders with effective run blocking is the key to a potent running attack. Mastering drive blocks, combo blocks, and leveraging techniques requires dedication, practice, and a deep understanding of these core principles. Bring these strategies into your playbook and watch your ground game flourish.
