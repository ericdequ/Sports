# Pass Protection Drills: Building Strength and Technique

When it comes to football, effective pass protection is a non-negotiable skill for any successful offensive lineman. Blocking a fierce edge rusher or maintaining a solid pocket for your quarterback requires a blend of raw strength, refined technique, and exceptional hand-eye coordination. In this article, we'll break down some core pass protection drills designed to build these critical attributes.

## The Importance of Pass Protection

Effective pass protection is the firewall of any passing game. Without it, even the most talented quarterbacks and receivers can't execute. To be outstanding at it, you must:

1. **Develop core and upper body strength**.
2. **Perfect your footwork and stance**.
3. **Hone your hand techniques for blocking and countering defensive moves**.

### Core Drills for Building Strength

Strength isn't just about how much you can lift; it's also about stability and control. Here are some drills to incorporate into your routine:

#### 1. **Sled Pushes and Pulls**

**Objective**: Enhance leg drive and upper body strength.

**How To**:
- Push a weighted sled for a specified distance (e.g., 20 yards).
- Pull the sled back using a harness.

**Reps**: 3 sets of 5 trips.

#### 2. **Medicine Ball Chest Throw**

**Objective**: Improve explosive upper body power.

**How To**:
- Stand facing a wall about 3 feet away.
- Hold a medicine ball at chest level.
- Explosively throw the ball against the wall and catch it on the rebound.

**Reps**: 3 sets of 10 throws.

### Technical Drills for Improved Technique

Technique can make or break your ability to protect the passer. Here are some drills that focus on footwork, hand placement, and maintaining balance:

#### 3. **Kick Slide Drill**

**Objective**: Develop quick, efficient lateral movement.

**How To**:

### Enhancing Hand-Eye Coordination

Hand-eye coordination is crucial for reacting to defensive maneuvers. Here are drills to sharpen this skill:

#### 5. **Tennis Ball Drills**

**Objective**: Enhance reaction time and improve hand-eye coordination.

**How To**:
- Have a coach or partner stand 10 feet away with tennis balls.
- Upon their throw, react quickly to catch or deflect the ball.

**Reps**: 20 throws per session.

#### 6. **Mirror Drill**

**Objective**: Improve your ability to shadow and counter defensive movements.

**How To**:
- Pair up with a teammate.
- One player (defender) moves laterally or changes direction.
- The other player (offensive lineman) mirrors their movements, working on staying in front and maintaining balance.

**Reps**: 3 sets of 1-minute intervals.
