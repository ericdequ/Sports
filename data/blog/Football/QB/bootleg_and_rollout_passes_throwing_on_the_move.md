# Bootleg and Rollout Passes: Throwing on the Move

Throwing on the move is a skill that differentiates the elite quarterbacks from the rest. Bootleg and rollout passes are particularly effective for evading pressure, creating passing lanes, and taking advantage of a defense's weaknesses. In this article, we'll break down the key elements of executing these plays, focusing on footwork, maintaining accuracy, and reading the defense. Whether you're a player looking to enhance your skills or a coach aiming to fine-tune your Teams performance, this guide has you covered.

## What are Bootleg and Rollout Passes?

### Bootleg

A bootleg pass involves the quarterback faking a handoff and moving laterally (usually to the strong side), potentially drawing defenders away from the intended passing lane. This move requires stealth, speed, and precision.

### Rollout

The rollout pass is similar but does not necessarily involve a fake handoff. Here, the quarterback moves laterally or “rolls out” to either side immediately after the snap, aiming to find an optimal passing angle.

## Execution Breakdown

To master these passes, understanding the following aspects is crucial:

1. **Footwork**
2. **Maintaining Accuracy**
3. **Reading the Defense**

### Footwork

The foundation of any successful bootleg or rollout pass is impeccable footwork. Here’s a detailed look:

| Elements           | Bootleg Mechanism                                      | Rollout Mechanism                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stance**         | Start under center or shotgun                          | Start under center or shotgun                          |
| **Initial Steps**  | Carry out the fake handoff convincingly; pivot quickly | Quick pivot and sprint laterally                        |
| **Body Alignment** | Keep shoulders square to the line of scrimmage initially | Stay light-footed; keep eyes downfield                  |
| **Throwing Setup** | Plant lead foot and rotate hips for the throw           | Set feet quickly to release on the run                  |

### Pro Tips for Footwork

- **Stealth is Key**: For a bootleg, sell the handoff to freeze the defense.
- **Hips Don’t Lie**: Rotate your hips early to prepare for the pass without losing momentum.

### Maintaining Accuracy

Throwing accurately while on the move can be challenging. Here’s how to keep your throws on point:

| Key Elements       | Tips for Bootleg                                 | Tips for Rollout                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Foot Placement** | Plant your lead foot firmly before throwing      | Use quick, small steps to stabilize before throwing |
| **Arm Mechanics**  | Maintain normal throwing mechanics               | Adjust for quicker releases if necessary           |
| **Release Point**  | High and away from the body                         | Keep it consistent, even on the run                |

### Pro Tips for Accuracy

- **Focus on Mechanics**: Even on the move, keep your throwing mechanics as close to your normal as possible.
- **Practice Like You Play**: Simulate game situations in practice to build on-move accuracy.

### Reading the Defense

Anticipating defender movements and exploiting coverage gaps are vital. Here’s how to read the defense effectively:

| Key Elements       | Bootleg Strategies                            | Rollout Strategies                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Pre-Snap Read**  | Identify potential blitzers and coverages       | Note the alignment of the linebackers and DBs  |
| **During Rollout** | Observe LB flows and secondary movements        | Watch for the Secondary biting on action       |
| **Decision Making**| Take what the defense gives you - short pass or run | Exploit sideline and cutback lanes             |

### Pro Tips for Reading Defense

- **Eye Discipline**: Keep your eyes downfield to read the secondary.
- **Go Through Progressions**: Know your reads and make quick decisions based on defensive movements.

## Conclusion

Mastering the bootleg and rollout passes can significantly enhance your quarterback capabilities and offensive strategy. By focusing on precise footwork, maintaining on-the-move accuracy, and reading defenses effectively, you can exploit these plays to your advantage. Practice diligently, adopt these insights, and get ready to leave defenses scrambling.
