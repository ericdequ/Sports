# Scramble Drills: Making Plays Outside the Pocket

In modern football, the ability to extend plays and make something happen when a play breaks down is an invaluable skill for any quarterback. Scramble drills are the bread and butter that transforms a good quarterback into a great one. Let's dive into the techniques, benefits, and coaching wisdom that can help unlock this potential.

## Key Elements of Scramble Drills

### Extending Plays
The first and foremost purpose of scramble drills is to extend plays beyond their initial design. When a play breaks down due to defensive pressure, it’s crucial for the QB to stay calm and collected while seeking alternatives.

1. **Field Awareness**: The QB needs to keep their eyes downfield, identify open receivers, and read defensive coverage even while moving out of the pocket.
2. **Footwork**: Quick, agile footwork is vital to evade rushers and maintain balance, ensuring that the QB can make an accurate throw on the run.

### Making Throws on the Run
Throwing accurately while on the move is a challenging skill, but it can turn disastrous situations into big plays.

1. **Mechanics**: Keep a stable base, rotate the hips, and use the upper body to direct the throw.
2. **Eyes in the Right Place**: Always look for an open target instead of watching the pass rush.

### Creating Opportunities with Your Legs
Sometimes, the best play is to tuck the ball and take off. Recognizing when to run can create big yardage and keep defenses on their toes.

1. **Decision Making**: Instant assessment of risk vs. reward; knowing when to run can make all the difference.
2. **Open Field Running**: Effective use of cuts, jukes, and stiff arms can maximize gain and avoid heavy hits.

## Drills to Enhance Scramble Skills

### Cone Drill
Set up cones in a varied pattern to simulate defensive linemen. The quarterback maneuvers through the cones before making a throw on the run.

### Rollout Throws
Practice throwing to designated targets (like receivers or assistant coaches) while rolling out of the pocket, ensuring the QB can maintain accuracy and strength despite the movement.

### Live Scramble Drill
Incorporate defensive players like linebackers or defensive ends who rush the quarterback at half-speed, forcing the QB to react and make plays on the fly.

## Tips from the Pros

| Player | Quote |
|--------|-------|
| **Patrick Mahomes** | "My coach always tells me, 'Extend the play, but play smart.’ It’s all about finding that balance." |
| **Russell Wilson** | "Eyes downfield, always. Even when you're running." |
| **Aaron Rodgers** | "It's not always about the big play. Sometimes the smartest play is a short gain. Keep moving the chains." |

## Coaching Wisdom

### Communication is Key
Ensure your receivers are well-versed in scramble protocols. Routes should be adjusted on the fly, with receivers breaking off their original routes to find open space when the QB is under pressure.

### Consistent Practice
Incorporate scramble drills into regular practice sessions to build instinctive awareness and coordination between the QB and the rest of the offense.

### Film Study
Analyze game film with your QB to identify instances where scramble drills can be improved—whether it’s decision-making, mechanics, or recognizing opportunities to gain yardage with their legs.

## Conclusion

Scramble drills are not just about chaos; they are about creating order and opportunities out of it. A quarterback who can extend plays, throw accurately on the run, and make smart decisions with their legs is an asset that can change the game. Incorporate these drills, heed the wisdom of experienced players and coaches, and watch as your ability to make plays outside the pocket improves dramatically.

So lace up, get out there, and start scrambling!
