# The Puskas V-Drag: Classic Deceptive Dribbling

## Introduction

When it comes to football dribbling techniques that blend elegance with effectiveness, the Puskas V-Drag stands as a crown jewel. Named after the legendary Hungarian forward Ferenc Puskás, this move is designed to flummox defenders and create space even in high-pressure situations.

## Historical Significance

Ferenc Puskás, renowned for his prolific goal-scoring and impeccable technique, first popularized the V-Drag in the 1950s. As a player for both Real Madrid and the Hungarian national team, Puskás used this cunning move to maintain possession and execute game-changing plays. The V-Drag has since become a staple in the arsenal of modern players — a testament to its enduring effectiveness.

## Anatomy of the Puskas V-Drag

The Puskas V-Drag involves a multi-step process, designed to trick the defender into committing to one direction while you slip away in another. Below is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Initial Positioning:**
   * Ensure the ball is close to your dominant foot.
   * Angle your body slightly towards the direction you intend to fake.

2. **The V-Drag Execution:**
   * Push the ball forward slightly with the inside of your dominant foot.
   * Quickly pull the ball back towards your body with the sole of your foot, forming a "V" shape.

3. **Direction Change:**
   * Use the inside of your same foot to push the ball diagonally away in the direction you initially faked.
   * Accelerate to exploit the created space.
