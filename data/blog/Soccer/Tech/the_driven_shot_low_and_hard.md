# The Driven Shot: Low and Hard

## Introduction

In soccer, the driven shot is a fundamental technique that separates good strikers from great ones. A well-executed driven shot is characterized by its low trajectory and powerful impact, making it difficult for goalkeepers to save. This article dives deep into the mechanics, coaching tips, and common pitfalls associated with driven shots.

## Understanding the Driven Shot

### What is a Driven Shot?

A driven shot is a powerful, low shot characterized by its speed and piercing accuracy. Unlike lofted shots or chips, driven shots stay closer to the ground, exploiting the space between the goalkeeper and the defensive line.

### Why is it Effective?

- **Low Trajectory**: Easier to keep on target and harder for goalkeepers to reach.
- **Speed and Power**: Reduces reaction time for the goalkeeper.
- **Versatility**: Effective from both close-range and long-range positions.

## Technique Breakdown

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Approach**: Position your body slightly to the side of the ball.
2. **Foot Placement**: Plant your non-kicking foot about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the ball, pointing towards your target.
3. **Body Angle**: Lean slightly over the ball to keep the shot low.
4. **Striking the Ball**: 
   - **Contact Point**: Strike the center of the ball with the instep of your foot.
   - **Follow-Through**: Keep your follow-through low and direct, propelling the ball forward.
