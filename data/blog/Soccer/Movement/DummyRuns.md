# Dummy Runs: Deceptive Movements to Fool Defenders

In the world of soccer, attacking play isn’t just about technical skills or physical performance—it's also about intelligence and cunning. Dummy runs—intentional, deceptive movements designed to mislead defenders—stand out as one of the most sneaky yet effective tactics. When executed properly, dummy runs can open up a myriad of opportunities for attacking plays, turning tight defenses into Swiss cheese.

## The Anatomy of a Dummy Run

A dummy run, also known as a decoy run, involves a player making a movement as if they intend to receive the ball but, in reality, their primary goal is to draw defenders out of position. This creates space for teammates to exploit, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful attacking play. Here are the key elements to master a dummy run:

1. **Timing:** The run needs to be perfectly timed to ensure that defenders are committed and unable to recover quickly.
2. **Convincing Movements:** The runner must convincingly act like they are pursuing the ball. A half-hearted run won't fool anyone.
3. **Coordination:** Effective dummy runs require a deep understanding between teammates. Communication is often non-verbal and based on pre-rehearsed tactics.

## Types of Dummy Runs

Dummy runs come in various forms. Here are some common types that players and coaches should be familiar with:

### Diagonal Dummy Runs

In a diagonal dummy run, the runner moves across the field diagonally, often cutting between defensive lines. This type of run is particularly effective against zonal marking systems.

### Vertical Dummy Runs

Here, the player sprints directly towards the goal line, pulling central defenders with them. This opens up space for a shot or pass in the areas they vacate.

### Blind-Side Dummy Runs

This involves the attacker moving to the defender's blind spot before sharply moving in the opposite direction of the ball, tricking the defender into covering the wrong space.

## Examples in Professional Play

One of the most notable examples is Barcelona's Lionel Messi, whose dummy runs create space for players like Jordi Alba to exploit the flanks. Similarly, Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne often uses dummy runs to free up attacking lanes for Raheem Sterling.

### A Classic Scenario

Consider a scenario where a winger has the ball near the sideline. The striker makes a forward run, dragging the center-back with him towards the near post. Meanwhile, the attacking midfielder makes a late run into the space vacated by the striker, creating an open shot on goal.

**Position** | **Player**        | **Movement**                    | **Result**
:------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:
LW            | Winger            | Cross from the sideline         | Delivering the ball into the box 
ST            | Striker           | Dummy run towards near post     | Dragging the center-back along
AM            | Attacking Midfield| Late run into vacated space     | Unmarked shot on goal

## Tips for Coaches

1. **Drill It In Training:** Incorporate dummy runs in your regular training sessions. Use small-sided games to simulate real-match scenarios.
2. **Encourage Communication:** Develop non-verbal cues among your players for dynamic play.
3. **Analyzing Video Footage:** Use video sessions to identify moments where dummy runs could have been effective or where they were successfully executed.
4. **Adaptability:** Be prepared to tweak dummy run strategies based on the opposition's defensive setup.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding and incorporating dummy runs into your Teams playbook can give you the upper hand against even the most formidable defenses. These off-the-ball movements are a true testament to how cerebral the beautiful game can be. Practice, timing, and a deep understanding between players can transform simple decoy movements into match-winning scenarios.

Whether you're a seasoned coach or a budding player, mastering the art of the dummy run will surely elevate your understanding and execution of modern soccer tactics.
