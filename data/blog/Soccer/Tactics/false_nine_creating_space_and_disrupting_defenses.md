# False Nine: Creating Space and Disrupting Defenses

The role of a false nine in soccer has gained popularity, offering teams a unique tactical advantage by redefining striker responsibilities. This article breaks down its fundamentals, strategic impacts, and tips for players and coaches to master this dynamic role.

## What is a False Nine?

A false nine is a forward who, instead of staying in advanced attacking positions, drops deep into midfield areas. This movement disrupts traditional defensive structures and creates space for teammates to exploit.

## The Tactical Disruption

### Defensive Disorientation

When a false nine drops into midfield:
- The opposition's center-backs face a dilemma: follow the striker, leaving space behind them, or stay in position, allowing the striker time and space to collect the ball.
- This uncertainty disorients the defensive line, breaking their shape and creating opportunities.

### Creating Space for Wingers and Midfielders

By vacating the central attacking zone, a false nine pulls defenders out of position:
- Wingers can cut inside into the vacant space, finding themselves in prime scoring positions.
- Attacking midfielders can make late runs into the box, unmarked and ready to capitalize on through balls or crosses.

### Overloading the Midfield

The deeper position of the false nine creates numerical superiority in midfield:
- This overload in the midfield allows for better possession and control over the game.
- Midfielders can engage in quick one-twos and combinations, bypassing the opposition's pressing.
