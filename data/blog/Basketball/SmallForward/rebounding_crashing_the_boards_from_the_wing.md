# Rebounding: Crashing the Boards from the Wing

Rebounding is often seen as a big man's game, but savvy small forwards know how critical it is to crash the boards effectively. Let's dissect the nuances of rebounding from the wing, focusing on positioning, timing, and the pivotal role of offensive rebounds. Whether you're a rising player or a seasoned coach, these insights will enhance your understanding and execution of this crucial skill.

## Positioning: Establishing the Right Spot

### Defensive Rebounding

For small forwards, positioning starts well before the shot goes up. Key points include:
- **Anticipation**: Recognizing shot tendencies of opponents to predict where the ball will likely land.
- **Boxing Out**: Seal off your defender using your body. **Pro Tip**: Focus on pushing back and maintaining balance rather than just looking at the ball.
- **Perimeter Placement**: Position yourself just inside the three-point line on long shots, where missed threes often land.

### Offensive Rebounding

When attacking the offensive boards:
- **Weak-Side Crashes**: Often, the ball will miss to the weak side. Position yourself opposite the shooter to exploit this tendency.
- **Sneak Attacks**: Start from the three-point line and time your run to the hoop just as the shot goes up, catching defenders off-guard.

## Timing: The Essence of Rebounding

### Defensive Rebounding

Master the art of timing:
- **Second Jump**: The ability to quickly leave the ground a second time after the initial attempt is crucial. A quick second jump can make up for lack of height.
- **React, Don‚Äôt Predict**: React to the trajectory of the ball after it hits the rim rather than predicting the flight path. This can be practiced with varied shooting drills.

### Offensive Rebounding

Offensive boards require a keen sense of timing:
- **Shot Shadowing**: Follow the flight of the ball without getting too close to the defenders ‚Äì this keeps you in prime position to attack the glass.
- **Bounce Anticipation**: Understand the different bounce patterns from various shot types (e.g., long threes vs. close mid-range shots).

## The Importance of Offensive Rebounds

### Boosting Possession

- **Extra Possessions**: Offensive rebounds grant additional possessions, crucial in tight games.
- **Momentum Shift**: An offensive rebound followed by a quick put-back can demoralize opponents and energize your team.

### Statistics Breakdown 

To illustrate the impact, here‚Äôs a table showing team performance linked to offensive rebounds over a season:
