# Iso Scoring: Breaking Down Defenders One-on-One

To all my hoopers out there looking to elevate their one-on-one game, this post is for you. Iso scoring is one of basketball's marquee skills, embodying the pure essence of one player breaking down another. Let's dive deep into the art of ISO scoring, focusing on dribble moves, footwork, and the critical dance of creating separation.

## The Art of Iso Scoring

Isolation (Iso) scoring is about exploiting your strengths against a defender's weaknesses. This requires not just physical skills but a deep understanding of timing, angles, and defensive tendencies. Here’s a breakdown of essential elements.

### Dribble Moves

#### 1. **Crossover**

The crossover is the bread and butter of ISO moves. It involves quickly shifting the ball from one hand to the other, forcing the defender to change direction rapidly.

- **Execution Tip**: Keep it low and quick. Sync your upper body by exaggerating the initial move.
  
```markdown
**Players to Watch**: Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving
```

#### 2. **Hesitation (Hesi)**

A subtle pause that makes the defender lean or freeze. The Hesi can be combined with any attack move to create openings.

- **Execution Tip**: Show your eyes towards the basket or a fake pull-up to sell the move.

```markdown
**Players to Watch**: Kevin Durant, Trae Young
```

#### 3. **Step-Back**

The step-back creates space for a shot, especially when the defender is playing tight. This involves stepping back while dribbling.

- **Execution Tip**: Create contact with your defender before stepping back to ensure maximum separation.
  
```markdown
**Players to Watch**: James Harden, Luka Dončić
```

### Footwork

Good footwork is the unsung hero of effective ISO scoring. Here’s how you can utilize your feet to gain an advantage.

#### 1. **Triple Threat Position**

Always start from a strong triple-threat stance to keep your options open — dribble, pass, or shoot.

```markdown
**Core Principles**

- Feet shoulder-width apart
- Knees slightly bent
- Ball protected on hip
```

#### 2. **Jab Step**

A quick, decisive step towards the defender that can make them react, giving you an advantage.

- **Execution Tip**: Mix up your jabs – some should be selling a drive (deep jab), others a shot (short jab).

#### 3. **Pivoting**

Use your pivot effectively to keep the defender off balance. This is crucial when you've picked up the dribble.

- **Execution Tip**: Always keep your pivot foot grounded to avoid traveling.

### Creating Separation 

Separation is what ultimately allows you to get your shot off. Here's how to master it.

#### 1. **Change of Pace**

Sudden bursts of speed and abrupt stops can leave defenders in the dust. Mix up your tempo to keep them guessing.

```markdown
**Practical Drills**

- 3 Cone Drill (Sprint, Change Pace, Sprint)
- Stop'n Go Drills
```

#### 2. **Directional Changes**

Combining lateral movements with a mix of hesitations and crossovers can bewilder defenders.

#### 3. **Advanced Techniques**

* **In-and-Out Dribble**: Create the illusion of a drive before pulling back.
* **Spin Move**: Rotate around the defender using your pivot foot for a high-risk, high-reward maneuver.

## Iso Scoring Drills

Here are some drills to get better at ISO moves:

| Footwork Masterclass        | Develop quick, stable movements on court | Jab Step, Pivoting           |

## Concluding Thoughts

Iso scoring is an intricate dance of skill, strategy, and confidence. By integrating these techniques and drills into your training regimen, you’ll be breaking ankles and leaving defenders in the dust in no time.
