# Engaging in the Pick and Pop: Versatility for Modern Centers

In the evolving landscape of basketball, versatility is key to staying ahead. One offensive tactic that has become increasingly critical for modern centers is the *pick and pop*. This play not only diversifies the offensive arsenal but also takes advantage of the unique skill sets of contemporary big men. Let's dive deep into the pick and pop, its execution, and why it's a game-changer.

## What is the Pick and Pop?

In the classic pick and roll, the center sets a screen for the ball-handler and then rolls towards the basket for a potential pass and finish. The pick and pop adds a twist. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Setting the Screen**: The center sets a solid screen on the defender guarding the ball-handler.
2. **Popping Out**: Instead of rolling towards the basket, the center quickly moves to an open space on the perimeter or mid-range where they can receive a pass.
3. **Taking the Shot**: Once the ball is received, the center has the option to take an open jump shot or create another scoring opportunity.

This subtle but effective variation forces the defense to make difficult choices, often leading to defensive breakdowns.

## Advantages of the Pick and Pop

### Stretching the Defense

By stepping out to shoot, the center stretches the defense, pulling their defender away from the basket. This opens up the lane for drives, cuts, and gives more room for perimeter players to operate.

### Exploiting Defensive Mismatches

When a center can shoot reliably from mid-range or beyond the arc, it puts pressure on traditional centers who may struggle with perimeter defense. A slow-footed big man is often unable to contest quick shots effectively.

### Creating Multiple Threats

Incorporating the pick and pop adds another layer to the offense, creating multiple scoring options:

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Defender switches on the screen | Potential mismatch for ball-handler or open shot for the popping center |
| Defender stays with center | Ball-handler has an opening to drive to the basket |
| Help Defense Reacts | Creates open looks for other players on the perimeter |

## Skills Required for an Effective Pick and Pop

### Shooting Ability

Centers need a reliable jump shot from mid-range and, ideally, from three-point territory. This demands dedicated practice in shooting mechanics, consistency, and range.

### Screening Technique

Setting a good screen requires positioning, timing, and awareness. The screen should be solid enough to give the ball-handler an advantage while allowing the center to quickly transition to popping out.

### Awareness and Decision Making

The center must read the defense quickly and decide whether to shoot, pass, or drive. This requires high basketball IQ and situational awareness.

## Coaching Tips for Implementing the Pick and Pop

### Drills for Shooting

Incorporate shooting drills that simulate game conditions. Practice catch-and-shoot scenarios off screens and from various spots on the court.

### Emphasis on Communication

Encourage verbal and non-verbal communication between the ball-handler and the center. Clear signals and understanding can minimize mistakes and enhance execution.

### Developing Versatility

Train centers not only to shoot but also to make plays off the dribble when needed. This can include passing to cutters or taking a dribble or two for a better angle.

### Situational Drills

Practice the pick and pop in different game situations (e.g., end-of-quarter plays, against zone defenses). This ensures players are prepared to execute under pressure.

## Notable Players Who Excel in the Pick and Pop

### Dirk Nowitzki

A pioneer of the modern pick and pop, Dirk's shooting ability revolutionized the role of the NBA big man. His deadly accuracy from the perimeter made the Dallas Mavericks a perennial offensive threat.

### Al Horford

Known for his high basketball IQ and shooting touch, Horford effectively uses the pick and pop to create offensive opportunities, particularly with the Boston Celtics.

### Anthony Davis

Blending elite athleticism with a refined shooting touch, Anthony Davis's pick and pop game stretches defenses thin, making him a matchup nightmare.
