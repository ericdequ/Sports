# Executing the Pick and Roll: Creating High-Percentage Shots from the Center's Perspective

The pick and roll is a staple of modern basketball, and its effectiveness largely depends on the execution and synergy between the ball handler and the center. This article delves into the essential aspects of the pick and roll from the center’s point of view, focusing on setting the screen, rolling to the basket, and finishing with authority.

## Setting the Screen

A well-timed, solid screen can make all the difference in freeing up the ball handler and creating scoring opportunities. Here's how to set a screen like a pro:

1. **Positioning**: Stand shoulder-width apart, with knees slightly bent for stability.
2. **Angle**: Position your body at an angle that forces the defender to navigate around you, giving your ball handler the necessary separation.
3. **Contact**: Make firm but legal contact with the defender. Use your body to create space without extending your arms.
4. **Hold**: Maintain your position for a split second longer than you think is necessary. Many centers release too early, negating the screen’s effectiveness.

## Rolling to the Basket

The roll is where you transform from a screen-setter to a scoring threat. Your goal is to get to the rim quickly and efficiently:

### Timing

Once you've set the screen and the ball handler begins to make their move, pivot on the foot closest to the ball and roll towards the basket. This drill works wonders for perfecting the roll:

| Drill Name          | Description                     | Duration      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Rolling Reps        | Practice the roll without the ball to focus on footwork.  | 10 minutes     |
| Ball & Roll         | Add a ball handler to simulate game scenarios.  | 15 minutes     |
| Finish & Repeat     | Finish at the basket each roll, practicing layups and dunks. | 20 minutes     |

### Maintaining Vision

Keep your head up and eyes on the ball handler. Communication is key in this phase:
- Verbally cue the ball handler when you're ready to receive the pass.
- Use hand signals as a supplementary cue if necessary.

### Reading the Defense

Quickly assess the defensive setup:
- **Hard Hedge**: If the opposing big man steps out aggressively, roll quickly to the open space.
- **Drop Coverage**: If the defender sags back, you might have an open mid-range shot.
- **Switch**: If the defense switches, exploit the mismatch by sealing your new defender.

## Finishing at the Rim

Here’s where the hard work pays off. Finish strong and accurate to capitalize on your efforts:

1. **Gathering**: Secure the ball with a strong base. Use two hands to catch and then gather yourself for the shot.
2. **Footwork**: Use quick, controlled steps to maximize your balance and positioning relative to the basket.
3. **Focus on the Target**: Laser-focus on the spot you want to hit on the backboard or rim. Visualization enhances accuracy.
4. **Soft Touch vs. Power**: Decide whether to use a soft touch—like a floater—or power through with a dunk based on the proximity and defensive pressure.

### Finishing Moves:

| Move                | Best Used When                         | Key Technique                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Layup               | Close to the basket with minimal defense | High release off the backboard    |
| Dunk                | High-leverage play or over smaller defenders  | Explosive leap and firm grip on the ball |
| Hook Shot           | Short range but with a looming defender | High arc to avoid block attempts  |
| Floater             | Defense crowding the paint              | Soft touch with elevated angle    |
