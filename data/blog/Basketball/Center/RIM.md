# The Up-and-Under Move: Deceptive Finishing Around the Rim

Basketball is a game of skill, strategy, and sometimes pure deception. Among the numerous ways to outsmart a defender, the up-and-under move holds a special place. This classic yet underappreciated technique can turn the tables, especially when facing taller opponents. Let's dive into the intricacies of this move, covering its technique, applications, and drills to master it.

## Technique Breakdown

The up-and-under move is essentially a two-part maneuver: the fake and the finish. Each element requires precision and confidence.

### 1. The Fake

1. **Pivot Foot Placement**: The execution begins with having your back to the basket. Establish a strong pivot foot. This foot remains grounded while you make your move.
2. **Selling the Shot Fake**: Use your body and eyes to sell a strong shot fake. Extend your arms, elevate your eyebrows, and use a slight upward motion to convince the defender you're about to take the shot.
3. **Reaction Reading**: Pay close attention to the defender's reaction. Most likely, they'll jump or lean forward, creating an avenue for you to exploit.

### 2. The Finish

1. **Quick Footwork**: As the defender bites on the fake, use a quick step with the pivot foot to step through into an open lane.
2. **Maintain Balance**: Ensure your weight is evenly distributed during the pivot to maintain balance and control.
3. **Soft Touch**: Finish with a controlled layup or a short bank shot. Use the backboard when necessary.

## Situations for Use

The up-and-under move is particularly effective in the following situations:

- **Post-Up Play**: When you receive the ball with your back to the basket.
- **Mismatch Exploitation**: Against taller and more shot-block-happy defenders.
- **High Traffic Areas**: To create space under the basket when surrounded by multiple defenders.

## Advanced Tips and Tricks

- **Body Control**: Work on your core strength to maintain stability and control during the move.
- **Eyes on the Target**: Always keep your eyes on the rim, as it helps in executing a believable fake and accurate finish.
- **Variation**: Mix in other moves (e.g., drop step or spin move) to avoid becoming predictable.

## Drills to Master the Up-and-Under

Improving on this move requires dedicated practice. Here are some essential drills:

### Drill 1: Mirror Drill

### Drill 3: Defender Reaction Drill

## Notable Players Who Mastered the Move
