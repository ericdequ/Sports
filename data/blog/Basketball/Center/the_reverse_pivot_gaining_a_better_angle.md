## The Reverse Pivot: Gaining a Better Angle

Basketball is often a game of angles, footwork, and timing, and the reverse pivot is one of the fundamental moves that embody these elements. Whether you're looking to create a better scoring opportunity or a smarter passing lane, mastering the reverse pivot can provide a significant edge on the court. This article breaks down the mechanics of the reverse pivot, its applications, and why it's a must-have in your basketball toolkit.

### What is the Reverse Pivot?

The reverse pivot is a footwork technique where a player, usually with their back to the basket, pivots away from a defender instead of towards them. This move is instrumental in creating space, maintaining balance, and setting up for either a shot or a pass.

### Execution of the Reverse Pivot

To successfully execute a reverse pivot, follow these steps:

1. **Stance and Footwork**
    - **Initial Position**: Start in a triple threat position—knees bent, feet shoulder-width apart, ball secure between the chest and chin.
    - **Pivot Foot**: Establish your pivot foot; this is crucial since lifting this foot will result in a traveling violation.

2. **The Pivot**
    - **Backward Motion**: With the ball secure, spin on the ball of your pivot foot, swinging your non-pivot foot and body away from the defender.
    - **Balance**: Maintain a low and balanced stance during the pivot to protect the ball and keep control.

3. **Creating Space**
    - **Body Shielding**: Use your body to shield the ball from the defender as you pivot.
    - **Visual Assessment**: Keep an eye on your teammates and the defense to make an immediate decision once the pivot is complete.

### Applications of the Reverse Pivot

#### **Scoring Opportunities**

- **Post Moves**: In the low post, the reverse pivot can help you face up to the basket and take a clear, uncontested shot. For example, if you receive the ball on the block with your back to the defender, a swift reverse pivot can create the necessary space to shoot over a smaller or out-of-position defender.

- **Perimeter Moves**: For guards, utilizing the reverse pivot at the perimeter after receiving a pass can help change your angle and open up driving lanes or a step-back jumper.

#### **Passing Opportunities**

- **Passing Lanes**: From a forward position, the reverse pivot allows you to face the court, making it easier to see cutting teammates and potential passing lanes that were initially obscured by the defender.

- **Outlet Passes**: More experienced players use the reverse pivot to evade pressure and execute outlet passes, enabling fast breaks and transition plays.

### Advanced Tips and Drills

#### **Drills for Mastery**

1. **Mirror Drills**
    - Partner with a teammate to practice mirror drills focusing on the reverse pivot. One player acts as the defender, applying light pressure, while the other practices the pivot, aiming to keep the ball protected and find better scoring angles or passing lanes.
    
2. **Chair Drill**
    - Place a chair on the court to simulate a defender. Practice receiving the ball with your back to the chair and executing a reverse pivot around it.

#### **Situational Practice**

- **Game Simulation**: Incorporate the reverse pivot into scrimmages and five-on-five drills. Coaches should emphasize scenarios where players can apply the move, reinforcing its benefits in live play.

#### **Footwork Focus**

- Footwork is the crux of basketball. Conduct drills focusing on pivot technique independently of the ball, ensuring players become comfortable with the movement mechanics even under pressure.

### Conclusion

Mastering the reverse pivot can significantly elevate a player's game by opening up new scoring and passing angles. Coaches and players alike should invest time in practicing this technique, building the muscle memory and situational awareness necessary to utilize it effectively during games. Remember, it’s the small, fundamental moves like the reverse pivot that often separate good players from great ones.

#### **Remember:**

*"Perfect practice makes perfect."*
