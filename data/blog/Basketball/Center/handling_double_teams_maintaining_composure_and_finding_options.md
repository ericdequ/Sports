# Handling Double Teams: Maintaining Composure and Finding Options

When you’re controlling the post like a boss, double teams are inevitable. Defenders do it to neutralize your threat, but if you master handling these situations, you turn the pressure back on them. Here's how to maintain composure and make smart decisions when facing double teams.

## Recognizing Double Teams Early

### Stay Awake, Stay Alert
The key to outsmarting a double team starts with your awareness. Keep your head on a swivel, and don't get caught napping.

- **Scanning:** Constantly scan the court. Look out for tell-tale signs of a double team. Is the weak-side defender creeping closer? Are two or more defenders making eye contact or signaling?
- **Communication:** Listen to your teammates. Effective communication is crucial. They can alert you to incoming pressure you might not see.

### Advanced Scanning Table

| Indicator        | What to Look For | Response                                  |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Weak-Side Informing | Defender looking towards you and taking initial steps toward the key | Prepare to pass to a weak-side teammate or re-position |
| Eye Contact & Signals | Defenders exchanging glances or hand signals | Tighten handle and scan for open teammates |
| Defender’s Feet  | Feet pointing towards your positioning; aggressive close-in | Pivot to a counter move or initiate a post pass |

## Maintaining Composure

### Control the Tempo
Panic is your enemy. Double teams thrive on your mistakes.

- **High Basketball IQ:** Trust your skills and your instincts. Remain calculated with every move.
- **Core Strength:** Keep a strong, solid stance. Use your core and legs to hold your ground.
- **Use Fakes:** Employ head, shoulder, and ball fakes to disrupt the rhythm of the defenders.

### Key Composure Drills

- **Resistance Training:** Practice against simulated double teams using resistance bands.
- **Mirror Drills:** Use mirrors to work on reactive fakes without actual defenders.
- **Mental Visualization:** Spend time mentally rehearsing double-team scenarios and your responses.

## Finding Options

### Smart Passing
Effective post play isn’t just scoring – it’s playmaking.

- **Quick Decision Making:** Execute swift, precise passes out of the post to open teammates.
- **Working Angles:** Use bounce passes to cut through defenders' legs or overhead passes when defenders' arms are down.

| Passing Options       | When to Use          | Example                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Weak-Side Swing       | Early in the double team, especially from the weak side | Look to switch to a waiting shooter or slasher |
| Inside-Out            | When defenders fully commit to the double team near the basket | Find a guard open outside the three-point line |
| High-Low Passing      | When a tall defender guards you tightly | Find a cutting big man or a wide-wing player |

### Creating Space

- **Dribbling Out:** Use reverse pivots or dribble your way out of double teams, repositioning yourself while maintaining possession.
- **Sealing & Spacing:** Use your body to ‘seal’ one defender while carving out space for a pass with off-ball movement.

### Decision-Making Flowchart

```
    Recognize        → Evaluate positioning of defenders
       ⬇︎
     Decide           → Is an immediate pass viable?
      ⬇︎        ↘︎             ↘︎
   Pass         No → Execute advanced move or reposition  →  Assess pass opportunities
```
