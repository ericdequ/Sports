## Defensive Leadership: Setting the Tone on Defense

In basketball, the point guard is often considered the "floor general," responsible for orchestrating the offense and ensuring smooth gameplay. However, an elite point guard is also a defensive anchor, setting the tone and energizing their Teams defense. This article will delve into the defensive responsibilities of point guards, including on-ball pressure, stealing the ball, and directing teammates to fortify the Teams overall defensive posture.

### On-Ball Pressure: The First Line of Defense

One of the most crucial defensive responsibilities of a point guard is applying relentless on-ball pressure. Here are some key tactics:

- **Positioning and Angles**: Maintain a low defensive stance and angle your body to force the ball-handler toward the sideline or baseline, reducing their available options.
- **Hands Active**: Keep your hands active to disrupt passing lanes and contest shots without fouling.
- **Anticipation and Reaction**: Anticipate the ball-handler's moves and react swiftly. Study opponents' tendencies and develop a sense for when they'll pivot or cross-over.
