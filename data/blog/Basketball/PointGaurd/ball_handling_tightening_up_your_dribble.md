## Ball Handling: Tightening Up Your Dribble

When it comes to running the floor and maintaining possession, few skills are as crucial for point guards as ball handling. Let's break down some essential dribbling maneuvers that can elevate a point guard's game: the crossover dribble, behind-the-back move, and hesitation dribble.

### 1. The Crossover Dribble

The crossover dribble is a foundation of a point guard's repertoire. Here‚Äôs the lowdown on mastering it:

#### Breakdown

| Move        | Key Points                                                    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**   | Keep a low stance and square up to your defender.             |
| **Execution** | Shift your weight to your planted foot, pushing the ball to the other hand using your fingertips, not palms. |
| **Finishing** | Accelerate past your defender by exploding off your planted foot after the crossover. |

#### Tips:
- **Eyes Up**: Always keep your head up to watch defenders and potential passing lanes.
- **Mix Speeds**: A change in speed during the crossover can throw off even the best defenders.

### 2. Behind-the-Back Move

A behind-the-back dribble can be a stylish and effective way to switch directions while keeping the ball away from defenders.

#### Breakdown

| Move        | Key Points                                                    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**   | Dribble with your dominant hand while moving forward.         |
| **Execution** | As you plant your outside foot, pass the ball behind your back to your other hand. Ensure it doesn't bounce too high or too low. |
| **Finishing** | Gain immediate control with your non-dominant hand and be ready to make your next move. |

#### Tips:
- **Control**: Practice dribbling behind the back in a controlled manner before trying it at full speed.
- **Balance**: Maintain your balance and be agile to quickly change directions if needed.

### 3. Hesitation Dribble

The hesitation dribble, or "hesi," is a deceptive move designed to slow down and then blow past defenders.

#### Breakdown

| Move        | Key Points                                                    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**   | Drive hard to one direction, making the defender think you‚Äôre committed. |
| **Execution** | Briefly pause your dribble while slightly lifting your shoulders (but keeping your dribble alive). |
| **Finishing** | Explode past the defender as they momentarily freeze, confused by your hesitation. |

#### Tips:
- **Sell It**: The success of a hesitation dribble depends greatly on how well you sell the fake. Make it look like you're about to pull up for a shot.
- **Timing**: Practice varying the length of your hesitation to see what works best against different defenders.

### Practice Drills

1. **Crossover Dribble Drill**: Set up cones and alternate crossover dribbles as you zigzag through them.
2. **Behind-the-Back Drill**: Dribble up and down the court, alternating behind-the-back moves at each transition.
3. **Hesitation Dribble Drill**: Use a full-court setup where you practice hesitations at every marked spot (free-throw lines, half-court line).

### Conclusion

Tightening up your dribble as a point guard involves mastering these moves and consistently incorporating them into your gameplay. Remember, practice these skills regularly and watch game footage of elite point guards to understand their timing and execution. Ball handling isn‚Äôt just about fancy moves, it's about control, poise, and always staying one step ahead of the defense.

Happy Dribbling! üèÄ
