# The Floater: Scoring Over Big Men

In the world of basketball, scoring over towering shot blockers can be one of the most challenging tasks for guards. However, with the right technique and practice, one move can turn the tables: **the floater**. This shot, popularized by elite guards like Tony Parker, has become a crucial weapon in a guard's arsenal.

## What is a Floater?

The floater, also known as a **teardrop** or **runner**, is a high-arcing shot typically taken in the lane. It's especially effective when a guard drives to the basket and needs to shoot over a big man without risking a blocked shot. The ball “floats” above the outstretched hands of defenders, aiming for a soft touch off the glass or straight into the hoop.

### Key Elements of the Floater

To execute a textbook floater, a few critical components must be considered:
1. **Footwork**: Steps taken before the shot
2. **Timing**: Release to avoid defenders
3. **Arc**: High enough to clear the shot blocker
4. **Soft Touch**: Ensures the ball lands softly on the rim

|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Footwork**     | Quick, light steps to avoid travelling; either a small hop or a last-minute step helps gain balance                                             |
| **Timing**       | Releasing the ball right before the defender can jump, utilizing a quick release                                                                |
| **Arc**          | Creating a high, rainbow-like arc to ensure the ball sails above the defender’s reach while still having enough momentum to reach the basket    |
| **Soft Touch**   | Focusing on a gentle release to make the ball bounce softly on the rim, increasing the chances of a successful basket                          |

## Technique Breakdown

1. **Footwork and Balance**:
   - Begin your drive towards the basket.
   - Take a controlled, small gather step, ready to execute the floater.

2. **Grip and Release**:
   - Hold the ball with your shooting hand underneath and guiding hand on the side.
   - Without hesitating, flick your wrist to provide a soft touch.

3. **Arc and Target**:
   - Aim for a higher trajectory compared to a regular jump shot.
   - Visualize the ball dropping gently into the basket or using the backboard.

Tony Parker, one of the NBA's most proficient guards, perfectly blended speed, agility, and the floater to become a scoring threat. His ability to glide through the defense and execute a high-flying teardrop was instrumental in his multiple championships with the San Antonio Spurs.

## Drills and Practice Tips

1. **Chair Drill**: Place a chair at the free-throw line or below the basket, simulating a shot blocker. Practice driving and shooting the floater over the chair.
2. **Partner Drill**: Have a teammate act as a defender, jump at random times to mimic real-game shot-blocking situations.
3. **Repetition**: Consistently practice the floater from different angles and distances around the key.
