# The Up and Under: Crafty Finishing Around the Rim

One of the most effective and versatile moves in a basketball player's arsenal is the "Up and Under." This classic post move is a staple for players navigating the paint, especially when faced with taller defenders. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a budding baller, mastering the up and under can add a significant edge to your game.

## What is the Up and Under?

The up and under is a deceptive move that combines a fake shot with a quick pivot and finish. Its primary purpose is to get the defender off their feet with the fake, allowing the offensive player to step around and score uncontested. 

## Breaking Down the Move

### Steps to Execute an Up and Under

1. **Post Up Position**:
   - **Initiate Contact**: Begin by establishing position with your back to the basket, understanding the importance of footwork and balance.
   - **Protect the Ball**: Keep the ball away from the defender by shielding it with your body.

2. **Fake the Shot**:
   - **Make it Convincing**: Use a strong upward motion to sell the fake. Raise your eyes and shoulders to mimic a genuine shot.
   - **Watch the Defender**: The objective is to get the defender airborne or off balance.

3. **Pivot and Step Through**:
   - **Quick Pivot**: As the defender bites on the fake, pivot on your grounded foot and step around the defender.
   - **Keep Ball Control**: Use your body to maintain control and protect the ball from defensive swipes.

4. **Finish at the Rim**:
   - **Use the Backboard**: Aim for a high-percentage shot, often using the backboard to absorb any contact.
   - **Stay Balanced**: Maintain your composure through the finish, using soft touch around the rim.
