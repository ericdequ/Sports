# The Dream Shake: Hakeem's Signature Move

Basketball has seen its share of game-changing moves and iconic players, but few can match the elegance and effectiveness of Hakeem Olajuwon's Dream Shake. This legendary maneuver became a trademark for the Houston Rockets legend, helping him carve out a Hall of Fame career filled with unforgettable moments. This article will break down the Dream Shake, its execution, and how Olajuwon masterfully used it to leave defenders in the dust.

## The Anatomy of the Dream Shake

To understand why the Dream Shake is so effective, let's dissect its elements:

### Footwork

At its core, the Dream Shake relies on impeccable footwork. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Position:**
   - Start with your back to the basket, in a low and balanced stance.
   - Feel your defender and anticipate their weight distribution.

2. **First Fake:**
   - Pivot on your non-dominant foot (for Olajuwon, his left foot) to face the basket.
   - Ball-fake and jab-step towards the basket to make the defender shift their weight.

3. **Drop Step:**
   - Pivot back, using the same foot, drop-stepping into the paint.
   - Show the ball again, keeping it high to avoid a steal.

4. **Shake:**
   - The critical part – fake a shot or another move to draw the defender off balance.
   - Without hesitation, pivot on the opposite foot, spinning towards an open shot.

### Body Control and Timing

- **Body Control:** Maintain your center of gravity, and keep movements smooth and deliberate.
- **Timing:** Execute fakes convincingly; impatience ruins the move's effectiveness.

Hakeem's Dream Shake wasn't just about the physicality, it involved a psychological chess match. Here's how he mastered it:

Olajuwon's athleticism allowed him to adapt the Dream Shake against different defenders. He could:

- Turn to either shoulder.
- Transition into fadeaways or hook shots.
- Read the defender's reactions instantaneously and adjust.

### Consistency and Conditioning

- **Repetitions:** Hours of practice made the move second nature.
- **Fitness:** Supreme conditioning allowed him to maintain the move's efficiency late into games.
