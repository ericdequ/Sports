# The Post Hook: Scoring from the Block

If you've ever played basketball or watched the NBA, you've undoubtedly seen the magic of a well-executed post hook shot. This go-to move for many big men has been a staple for scoring within the paint. In this article, we'll drill deep into the post hook shot, dissecting its technique, historical significance, and tips to master it, just like the legend, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

## The Essence of the Post Hook

The post hook shot is predominantly used by centers and power forwards when they receive the ball in the low post. Here are the core elements that make this shot so effective:

1. **Positioning**: Setting up in the low block.
2. **Footwork**: Executing a drop step or quick pivot.
3. **Body Control**: Using your off-arm to shield the defender.
4. **Release Point**: High release to make it difficult to block.

### Why It's Unstoppable

The post hook is a dominant weapon because, when executed correctly, it becomes nearly unguardable. The shooter's body acts as a shield against the defender, while the high arc and wrist snap of the shot make it tough to block.

## The Technique Breakdown

Here's a step-by-step guide to nail the post hook shot:

1. **Receive the Ball in the Low Block**: Have a solid stance with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.
2. **Feel the Defender**: Use your backside to sense the defender’s position.
3. **Quick Turn**: Pivot on your inside foot while keeping the ball high and protected.
4. **Body to Defender**: Use your non-shooting arm to lightly fend off the defender.
5. **Shoot Over the Shoulder**: Extend your shooting arm over your shoulder, releasing the ball with a gentle flick of the wrist.

## Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Skyhook

One cannot discuss the hook shot without paying homage to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his patented skyhook. Here’s why it was so lethal:

- **Height**: Standing at 7'2", Kareem could release the ball from a high point that most defenders couldn’t reach.
- **Consistency**: His meticulous practice routine made the shot nearly flawless.
- **Form**: His skyhook was a variant of the traditional hook shot, with a more exaggerated arc and smoother release.

## Practice Drills

### Hook Shot Drill

**Objective**: Develop touch and precision for the hook shot.

1. **Warm Up**: Start close to the basket without defense.
2. **300 Reps**: Aim for 150 hooks with each hand from various angles.
3. **Form Focus**: Ensure correct form every time; it’s about quality, not just quantity.

### Defender Drill

**Objective**: Practice shooting against pressure.

1. **Partner Up**: Have a teammate play passive defense.
2. **Simulate Game Situation**: Make post moves like drop steps or up-and-unders before taking the hook shot.
3. **Vary Speed**: Practice at different paces, including game speed.

| Drill Name       | Purpose                | Repetitions |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Hook Shot Drill  | Touch and Precision    | 300 reps    |
| Defender Drill   | Real-game Simulation   | Varies      |

## Coaching Tips

1. **Instill Confidence**: Encourage players to take the shot in practice and during games.
2. **Physicality**: Teach how to use the body to protect the ball and gain leverage.
3. **Mental Toughness**: Help players develop a mindset to handle missed shots and bounce back quickly.

## Conclusion

The post hook shot is an art form that remains instrumental in basketball. By understanding its technique and history, particularly through the lens of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s skyhook, players can add a formidable weapon to their offensive arsenal. With diligent practice and strategic coaching, scoring from the block can become second nature.
