# Drawing Fouls: Getting to the Free Throw Line

Getting to the free throw line can change the outcome of a game. By drawing fouls, players not only earn easy points but also put opposing players in foul trouble. Let's dive into several techniques to master this art, including pump fakes, aggressive drives, and initiating contact.

## Techniques to Draw Fouls

### Pump Fakes
Pump fakes are a classic move used to get defenders off their feet. Here’s how to do it effectively:

1. **Sell the Shot**: Make your pump fake look like a real shot attempt. Use the same form and rhythm.
2. **Stay Low**: Keep a low center of gravity to maintain balance and readiness to capitalize on the defender’s reaction.
3. **Draw Contact**: Once the defender is in the air, lean in slightly to ensure contact and draw the foul.

### Aggressive Drives
Driving aggressively to the basket is another way to draw fouls. Here’s what you need to know:

1. **Explode to the Rim**: Use a quick first step to beat your defender and create a lane to the basket.
2. **Body Control**: Maintain control of your body to absorb contact effectively. Use your off-hand to shield the ball.
3. **Anticipate Contact**: Expect contact and be ready to finish strong or sell the foul.

### Initiating Contact
Initiating contact smartly can get you to the line more often. Here are the key points:

1. **Create Contact Zones**: Understand where you can initiate contact within the rules—using your shoulder or hip without pushing off.
2. **Seek the Defender**: Move towards the defender’s body to make the contact look natural.
3. **Flare and Finish**: After contact is made, exaggerate your motion to sell the foul to referees.
