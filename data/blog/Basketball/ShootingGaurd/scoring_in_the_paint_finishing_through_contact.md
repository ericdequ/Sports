# Scoring in the Paint: Finishing Through Contact

Scoring in the paint is an essential skill for any basketball player, whether you’re a guard driving to the basket or a big man maneuvering in the post. Finishing through contact requires a blend of finesse, strength, and technique. From layups and floaters to absorbing and finishing through contact, this guide dives deep into the art of scoring in the paint.

## Understanding the Basics

### The Layup

The layup is a fundamental skill every player must master. Key aspects include:

1. **Footwork**: Use the correct footwork to establish a solid base.
2. **Angles**: Approach the basket at a favorable angle to utilize the backboard effectively.
3. **Soft Touch**: Develop a soft touch to drop the ball into the basket.

### The Floater

The floater, also known as a tear-drop, is a crucial shot for guards facing tall defenders in the paint. Key points include:

1. **Release Point**: A high release point to get the shot over shot-blockers.
2. **Arc and Touch**: Ensure a high arc and soft touch to increase scoring chances.
3. **Body Control**: Maintain good body control to shoot off one or two legs.

## Techniques for Finishing Through Contact

### Using Your Body

When driving to the basket with defenders on you, use your body to shield the ball and absorb contact:

1. **Use of Off-Hand**: The off-hand can be used to create space and reduce the impact of contact.
2. **Body Positioning**: Position your body between the defender and the ball.
3. **Absorb and Finish**: Absorb contact with your body, maintaining focus on finishing the shot.

### Strength and Balance

Strength and balance are critical for finishing through contact. Key exercises to enhance these attributes include:

1. **Core Workouts**: Strengthen your core to maintain balance and stability.
2. **Lower Body Exercises**: Squats, lunges, and plyometrics to build leg strength.
3. **Upper Body Training**: Focus on the chest, shoulders, and arms for better control.
