# Passing from the Post: Creating Opportunities

In the fast-paced world of basketball, working the post can be a game-changer when executed with finesse. One of the fundamental aspects of post play is the ability to make effective passes, especially when facing defensive pressure like double teams. In this article, we will break down the critical components of passing from the post, share player insights, and offer coaching wisdom to maximize scoring opportunities for your team.

## The Fundamentals of Post Play

Playing from the post position, often referred to as the 'block,' involves more than just scoring. It's about being a pivotal playmaker who can distribute the ball effectively. Here are the key principles:

### Setting Up in the Post

- **Body Positioning**: Establish a strong, wide base with knees bent for balance.
- **Using the Body**: Use your back and arms to shield the ball from defenders.
- **Communication**: Alert your teammates when you're in a favorable position to receive the pass.

### Recognizing Double Teams

One of the classic defensive strategies is the double team. Understanding and reacting to this can turn a pressure situation into an assist opportunity.

- **Anticipation**: Read the defense to anticipate when a double team is coming.
- **Vision and Awareness**: Keep your head up to survey the court and locate open teammates.
- **Quick Decision-Making**: Decide quickly whether to pass out or make a move before the double team arrives.

## The Art of Passing from the Post

Passing from the post is an advanced skill that requires timing, precision, and teamwork. Here are different types of passes and scenarios:

| Pass Type              | Description                                                                                        | Tips for Execution                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Kick-Out Pass**      | Passing out to the perimeter, usually for a three-point shot.                                       | Spot the shooter before the double team closes.  |
| **Cross-Court Pass**   | Passing diagonally across the court to an open teammate.                                           | Execute with speed and accuracy to avoid steals. |
| **High-Low Pass**      | From one post player to another, usually from high post to low post or vice versa.                  | Ensure good timing and an open passing lane.     |
| **Bounce Pass**        | A pass that bounces once before reaching the receiver, useful for short distances.                  | Low and quick to avoid defenders' hands.         |
| **Overhead Pass**      | Throwing the ball over defenders, often used when directly under the basket.                        | Use strong wrist action for control.             |

### Creating Scoring Opportunities

By mastering these passes, you not only become a scoring threat but also a facilitator, directly contributing to your Teams offensive versatility. Here's how:

1. **Stretch the Defense**: Effective post passes force defenders to cover more ground, creating gaps in the defense.
2. **Inside-Out Game**: Use kick-out passes to set up perimeter shooters, keeping the defense honest.
3. **Cutting Lanes**: Encourage teammates to cut to the basket when the ball is in the post position, using quick passes for easy layups.

## Coaching Tips for Post Players

Coaches, here are some drills and strategies to enhance your players' passing abilities from the post:

- **Passing Drills**: Implement drills that simulate game scenarios where players practice passing out of double teams.
- **Film Sessions**: Analyze game footage to teach players how to recognize defensive rotations and double teams.
- **Communication Drills**: Encourage constant communication on the court to keep everyone aware of their positioning.

## Player Insights: What the Pros Say

Many professional players emphasize the mental aspect:

*"It's about staying calm under pressure and having the confidence to make the right pass,"* says Marc Gasol, known for his exceptional post-passing ability. Understanding your teammates' tendencies can help you anticipate their movements and make smarter plays.

## Conclusion

Passing from the post is more than just a skill; it's an art that requires awareness, decision-making, and teamwork. By recognizing defensive schemes like double teams and developing a variety of passes, players can create countless scoring opportunities for their team. Whether you're a player looking to improve your post game or a coach aiming to enhance your Teams offense, mastering the art of passing from the post is a crucial step toward success on the court.
