## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User Input via SMS/Email**  
   - You text “Giants 24–21 Chargers Q4” or email “Emmys lead host monologue” to the PlayByPlay AI address.  
   - Our gateway (Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email) ingests the message and extracts keywords: teams, score, event phase.

2. **Event Context & API Lookup**  
   - A real‑time event parser identifies the game or TV show based on keywords and timestamp.  
   - It fetches metadata (key plays, trending hashtags, official highlight URLs) via sports and entertainment APIs.

3. **Meme‑Moment Synthesis**  
   - An AI engine cross‑references a library of meme templates, GIF snippets, and caption styles.  
   - It selects the clip or image that best matches the context (e.g., a “cursed face” GIF for a blown lead, a celebratory reaction for a game‑winning TD).

4. **Delivery**  
   - The service packages the chosen asset with a smart caption and sends it back via SMS MMS or email attachment/link.  
   - Optionally includes a Quick‑Share button for Twitter, Instagram, or WhatsApp.

## 🚧 Quickest MVP Blueprint

1. **Twilio SMS Endpoint**  
   - Configure a Twilio number that forwards incoming texts to a simple webhook.  
2. **Keyword Extractor Service**  
   - A lightweight Flask/Express app that uses regex and a small ML model (spaCy) to pull out event keywords.  
3. **Event Lookup Module**  
   - Integrate one public sports API (e.g., ESPN or TheSportsDB) and one entertainment RSS feed for award shows/TV events.  
4. **Meme Library & Selector**  
   - Curate a folder of 50–100 GIFs and static meme templates. Map tags to each asset manually for MVP.  
5. **Response Formatter**  
   - For SMS: send MMS with meme URL or GIF; for email: embed image and alt‑text caption.  
6. **Deploy & Iterate**  
   - Host on Heroku or Vercel, test with a small user group, gather feedback, and expand event coverage and template library.
