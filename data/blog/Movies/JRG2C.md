## 🎬 Elevator Pitch: *JR & Gareth Go to College*

What happens when **JR Smith**—NBA champion turned scholar—and **Gareth Bale**—Champions League icon with a backswing better than his bicycle kick—decide to go back to **college**?

No, not for keg parties or extra credit.  
They go back… to **play collegiate golf.**  
Legally. Competitively. Outrageously.

> 🎯 *Think*: “Mac & Devin Go to High School” meets “Happy Gilmore” meets “The Last Dance”… but at a Division I golf tournament.

## ⛳ Premise

Two retired sports legends, burned out by fame but bonded by their shared love of golf, enroll at a small liberal arts university with one mission:  
**Win the NCAA Championship—and graduate while they’re at it.**

They’re twice the age of their teammates, allergic to dorm food, and still learning how Canvas works. But when it comes to clutch shots, team leadership, and zen trash talk? They’re masters.

Along the way:
- Gareth teaches meditation through putting.
- JR mentors student-athletes in life *and* shot shaping.
- Their golf team of lovable nerds becomes a national threat.
- Chaos erupts when they qualify for the championship… and the school’s booster board realizes what they’ve done.
