# 🧲 Wake Winch: The Modular System That Turns Boats into Floating Amusement Parks

**What if your wake rack did more than hold boards?**  
**What if your boat was also your park, your zipline base, and your aquatic tow hub?**

## 🎣 Tow Anything. Anywhere.

The Wake Winch mounts directly onto **standard wakeboard racks** and turns your ride into a **mobile launch pad**:

- 🎯 **Tow in jet skis** stuck offshore or needing a launch assist  
- 🛟 Perfect for tubes, inflatables, or even **kayak pick-ups**  
- 🚤 Works while idling or cruising at low speeds  

The winch system is **powered, retractable**, and **hydraulically controlled via remote or app**—so it’s hands-free, smooth, and safe.

> “It’s not just a winch—it’s a lake-sidecar system.”

## 🔗 Combine Two Boats. Make a Zipline.

Now here’s where it gets ridiculous in the best way:

Using two Wake Winches—**mount on two separate boats** and activate **Zip Mode**:

- Tension-controlled **rope between vessels**  
- Riders can hook in and **zipline from boat to boat**  
- Great for **wake stunts, freestyle entries, or cinematic shots**

This isn’t your grandpa’s lake.  
This is the **future of floating adrenaline architecture.**

- Includes **modular rails, floating ramps, and app-controlled rope tension**

Set it up in minutes.  
Adjust height, tension, and angle in real-time.
